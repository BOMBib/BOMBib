BOMBib - App Repository
=======================

*If you want to contribute projects see the [Library Repository](https://github.com/BOMBib/library).*

The motivation behind this project is to create a searchable and user-expandable
library(Bibliotheca) of Bill-Of-Materials for DIY electronic projects.
First of all it was intended for electronic music/synthesizer and
modular/eurorack/kosmos related projects, but might also be useful for other
project types.

The tool is supposed to allow you to combine multiple BOMs/Projects into a list
that allows you to calculate how many components you need for multiple projects
and what the estimated component cost would be.
The inspiration behind this was the
[Modular in a Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DKU1m5_b_8)
YouTube series by
[Kristian Bl√•sol](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9NeBnf-9pzDC3C86MeOJvA) that
[had a similar table](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fn9gbn0vo0fteab/MIAW%20Component%20list.xlsx?dl=0).
